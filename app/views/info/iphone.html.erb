	There is a new application on the App Store that we are very excited to announce.  It is the broncodashboard app.  The broncodashboard app is an extention of the broncodashboard website.  Some the features include the current Boise State Football schedule, the Boise State Football team roster, and an RSS feed of the hometown Boise State Broncos Football coverage.

<p style="font-size: 1.5em;margin-left: 75px;margin-right:75px;">
	We hope that you enjoy this app as much as we do.  If you have issues or feature requests you can email JustinBKay@gmail.com and I'll respond as I have answers to your queries.
